RevoSSL is a plugin that will allow you to secure (make SSL) the Manager and 
any web page that you would like to have secure.  

NOTE: You can also set the Manager to SSL via Apache/Nginx rules. Which would be the preferred method. 
    If you use this method set the revoSSL.enableManager to No. Then you will not have infinite loops and still be able to set individual page to SSL. 

Install:
1. Install via the MODX Revolution package management

To Secure the Manager:
1. Go to System -> System Settings
2. Look for revoSSL.enableManager (if it is not there then create it) and set it to Yes
  Key: revoSSL.enableManager
  Name: Force Manger http(s)  
  Field Type: Yes/No
  Value: Yes
  Description: If you select Yes then it will force all manager pages to be http if revoSSL.manager is set to No and https if it is set to Yes.

3. Look for revoSSL.manager (if it is not there then create it) and set it to Yes
    To create Setting:
    Key: revoSSL.manager
    Name: Secure the Manger
    Field Type: Yes/No
    Value: Yes
    Description: If you select Yes then it will force all manager pages to be SSL.
    
4. Now open up a new tab and go to your manager and verify that it worked.  If it did not work or 
    if you donâ€™t have SSL on your server you can still go back to your original tab and then set the value to No.
